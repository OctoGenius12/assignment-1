        <h3>History of Switzerland</h3><br>
        <p>Switzerland’s history is one of a medieval defensive league formed during a time and in an area lacking imperial authority. The different cantons (traditionally called Orte in German) were to a large extent independent states that remained united through the shared defense of liberty, which was understood as the protection of imperial privileges and franchises. Unlike all similar confederations (e.g., the Hanseatic and Swabian leagues) and despite endemic internal strife, especially after the Reformation in the 16th century, the Swiss Confederation survived the formation of (princely) modern states without adapting to it. With Venice, Genoa, and the Netherlands, the confederation formed the republican exception in Europe, and it developed political structures less as a unified nation than on the level of the 13 cantons that the Swiss Confederation comprised by the time of the Reformation. The early modern confederation also included, with reduced say, the Zugewandte Orte, districts and towns (such as Geneva and Graubünden) that were allied to and subsequently became a party of the confederation.

        Switzerland was (along with San Marino) the only early modern republic to survive the reign of Napoleon I. It modernized its political structures in its 1848 constitution, successfully adopting liberal principles such as individual rights, separation of powers, and parliamentary bicameralism enshrined in the French Revolution (1789) and the U.S. Constitution. In the preceding period of crisis from the end of the 18th century to the mid-19th century, the confederation integrated the French- and Italian-speaking cantons and large rural areas, which earlier had been dominions of oligarchic or democratic regimes. Thus, Switzerland avoided breaking apart like other traditional states on mountain ridges such as Navarre or Savoy, which were destroyed by the idea of “natural boundaries,” or the Habsburg empire, which was eventually torn apart and reduced to its German element by those espousing nationalism. A product of the European balance of power and, after 1499, attacked only once (1798), Switzerland has enjoyed peace for most of its existence and was spared from two world wars in the 20th century, when the gradually developed concept of “armed neutrality” was respected by its neighbours. Economic prosperity largely followed as Switzerland adapted well to the Industrial Revolution and the growth of international finance markets, despite internal social strife in the decades around the turn of the 20th century.
